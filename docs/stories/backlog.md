## 🔧 Tech Debt

### TD-3.1.2 — Normalize 400 error shape across validation paths

- **Priority:** 🟢 Low
- **Related Story:** 3.1 (qwen-image-edit-i2i)
- **Source:** QA Gate F2 (Round 1), deferred to backlog at Round 2 (Path A + user approval)
- **Description:** `serverless/handler.py:482` returns `{error, message, code}` for `InputValidationError`; `serverless/handler.py:485` returns `{error, code}` for `ValueError`/`TypeError`. Additive, non-breaking, but inconsistent. Unify to always include optional `message` field OR document the distinction in `docs/api/reference.md`.
- **Suggested Owner:** `@dev`
- **Estimated Effort:** 10 min
- **Tags:** error-handling, api-consistency, story-3.1, epic-3
- **Unblock Condition:** None (can be picked up opportunistically)
- **Created:** 2026-04-24 by `@po` (Round 2 closure handoff)

### TD-3.1.3 — Run CodeRabbit self-healing loop post-release on feature/3.1 branch

- **Priority:** 🟢 Low
- **Related Story:** 3.1 (qwen-image-edit-i2i)
- **Source:** QA Gate F5 (Round 1), deferred at Round 2 with explicit user approval; deferral re-affirmed 2026-04-24 Task 10 pre-flight when CodeRabbit returned HTTP 429 `Rate limit exceeded, try after 45 minutes and 59 seconds` (external platform limit, not code defect)
- **Description:** Run `~/.local/bin/coderabbit --prompt-only --base main` against the feature/3.1-qwen-image-edit-i2i branch once rate limit resets. Reviews all 4 commits (a909447 → df12317). Expected zero CRITICAL/HIGH findings — QA Round 4 PASS 94, 42/42 pytest green, pod smoke PASS, commit diff manually reviewed by @qa. Register any surprising findings as follow-up fix stories.
- **Suggested Owner:** `@dev`
- **Estimated Effort:** ~15 min run + 5-15 min findings triage
- **Tags:** coderabbit, quality-validation, story-3.1, epic-3, post-release-gate
- **Unblock Condition:** CodeRabbit platform rate limit window reset (usually 45-60 min after hit) + local CLI auth already configured on 2026-04-24
- **Priority Window:** Before Epic 3 closure if possible; otherwise post-release cleanup
- **Retry Evidence:** `docs/qa/coderabbit-reports/3.1-pre-pr-review-20260424-094556.md` (captures the rate-limit response)
- **Created:** 2026-04-24 by `@po` (Round 2 closure handoff); expanded 2026-04-24 by `@devops` (Task 10 pre-flight rate-limit)

## 📌 Follow-ups

### FU-4.2.1 — KV writes/day monitoring + alert at 80% of free-tier ceiling

- **Priority:** 🟡 Medium
- **Related Story:** 4.2 (Gemma Gateway + RunPod text endpoint)
- **Source:** @po Pax review on 2026-04-24 — user question about Cloudflare gateway security + free-tier rate-limit ceiling
- **Context:** Cloudflare Workers KV free-tier hard-cap is **1,000 writes/day per account** (CF docs 2026). Each gateway call (image submit OR text generate) costs ~2 KV writes (`count:` increment + `tokens:` post-flight accounting). At 200 calls/day combined alpha policy we sit at ~20% of quota; 500 calls/day ≈ 100% (service breaks silently — KV writes throttle, rate-limit logic produces stale data).
- **Description:** Add daily observability check to gateway:
  - Read `count:YYYY-MM-DD` and `tokens:YYYY-MM-DD` cumulative writes-equivalent metrics
  - Emit `alert: kv_write_budget_high` log event when daily writes approach 800 (80% of free-tier 1K/day cap)
  - Wire notification (GitHub issue auto-create OR Discord webhook OR email — TBD)
  - Acts as the trigger to upgrade Workers Paid (<incremental cost>, 1M writes/month = 33× headroom)
- **Suggested Owner:** `@dev` (instrumentation in `gateway/src/log.ts` or new `gateway/src/observability.ts`)
- **Estimated Effort:** ~2h implementation + ~30min alert wiring
- **Tags:** observability, rate-limit, free-tier, cost-control, story-4.2, epic-4
- **Trigger:** Story 4.2 close OR first month of Story 4.4 (alpha launch) — whichever comes first
- **Created:** 2026-04-24 by `@po` (Pax)

### FU-4.3.1 — Workers Paid upgrade pre-flight before per-key rate-limit lands

- **Priority:** 🟠 High (blocks Story 4.3+ if per-key rate-limit is in scope)
- **Related Story:** 4.3 (SDK + examples — anticipated per-key rate-limit need per ADR-0004 Implementation Notes)
- **Source:** @po Pax review on 2026-04-24 — user question about Cloudflare gateway security + free-tier rate-limit ceiling
- **Context:** When Story 4.3+ implements per-key rate-limit (KV key format `tokens:{api-key-hash}:{date}` per ADR-0004 §Implementation Notes "Future (Story 4.3+): Per-key, multi-tier budgets"), each gateway call costs **3+ KV writes** (global `count:` + global `tokens:` + per-key `tokens:hash:`). Free-tier ceiling drops from ~500 calls/day → ~333 calls/day. Plus Story 4.3 SDK + example traffic typically pushes daily volume up. Need to upgrade infra BEFORE the code change ships.
- **Description:** Before any Story 4.3 work that adds per-key rate-limit:
  - Validate budget approval for Workers Paid (<incremental cost> = $60/yr)
  - @devops upgrades CF account: Workers Free → Workers Paid via dashboard
  - Verify monthly quota: 10M requests, 1M KV writes — covers 30K calls/day comfortably
  - Document upgrade in deploy runbook + post-mortem
- **Suggested Owner:** `@po` (budget approval) + `@devops` (CF account upgrade + verification)
- **Estimated Effort:** ~30min budget decision + ~10min CF dashboard upgrade + ~10min verification
- **Tags:** infra-upgrade, rate-limit, paid-tier, cost, blocker-for-4.3, epic-4
- **Trigger:** Story 4.3 kickoff (before any per-key code change is committed)
- **Cost Impact:** +<incremental cost> recurring (covered within Phase 0 cost-model headroom: alpha projection $12-15/mo + $5 = $17-20/mo, still well under <alpha cost ceiling>)
- **Created:** 2026-04-24 by `@po` (Pax)

## ✨ Enhancements

### ENH-2.9 — Refactor landing into Astro Starlight docs portal ✅ CLOSED 2026-04-30

- **Status:** ✅ **CLOSED** — delivered via Story 2.9 (PR #19 + #20 merged 2026-04-29/30). Production live at `deploy-lp-one.vercel.app/`.
- **Story:** [`docs/stories/2.9.docs-portal-refactor.story.md`](2.9.docs-portal-refactor.story.md) — Status: Done. QA gate PASS 96.
- **Final delivery:** Astro Starlight portal at `web/docs/` with 5 pages (Welcome · Quickstart · API Reference · SDK · Errors). Brand identity preserved (`#1d7fe5` accent + Inter/JetBrains Mono — corrected from spec's hypothesized teal+Geist after reading actual landing config). Multi-image i2i documented in 3 places. Lighthouse 100/100/100/100 across all 5 pages, zero axe-core violations. Old landing archived to `web/_archive/landing-pre-docs-2026-04-29/`. Vercel project rootDirectory cutover from `null` → `web/docs` via API + git-source deploy.
- **Closure metadata:**
  - **Effort actual:** ~14h end-to-end (vs estimated ~9-12h). Drift driven by Codex sandbox blocker on Phase 1 (resolved by main session pivot, documented as memory) + 2 unplanned QA rounds + 1 user-reported bug fix pre-cutover.
  - **PRs:** #19 (main implementation, 7 commits squash-merged) + #20 (archive + tooling, 1 commit squash-merged)
  - **Merge commits on main:** `b2171ab` (PR #19) + `88424f8` (PR #20)
  - **V2 follow-ups:** consolidated as ENH-2.10 below.
- **Created:** 2026-04-29 by `@po` (Pax) · **Closed:** 2026-04-30 by `@po` (Pax)

### ENH-2.10 — Docs portal V2 polish (post-Story-2.9 follow-ups)

- **Priority:** 🟢 Low (bundle of nice-to-haves, none individually urgent)
- **Related Story:** Successor to ENH-2.9 / Story 2.9. Triggered post-cutover during pre-cutover review + UX signoff caveats.
- **Source:** Story 2.9 Dev Notes "V2 backlog" + UX review caveats (`docs/qa/2.9-ux-review.md`) + design decision artifacts during the cutover sweep.
- **Description:** Bundle of polish items deferred from Story 2.9 V1. Each can be picked individually and become a small standalone story when prioritized. Sub-items (priority order):

  | # | Item | Trigger to schedule | Effort |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | **Bundle Inter + JetBrains Mono via `@fontsource/*`** | First feedback "fonts look weird on Windows" or any cross-OS fidelity issue | ~30min |
  | 2 | **Light theme support** (revert ThemeSelect override, add light-mode token bindings, run Lighthouse) | Once accessibility audit requests light mode OR non-dev-audience feedback | ~3-4h |
  | 3 | **Custom `IconLinkCard` atom** (Starlight component override accepting `title` + `description` + `href` + `icon`) | If 3+ alpha users say emoji prefixes feel unprofessional or want SVG icons back | ~30-45min |
  | 4 | **Custom 404 page** (replace Starlight default with branded copy + helpful links to top pages) | Anytime — small UX polish | ~30min |
  | 5 | **ADR index page** linked from Welcome `Resources` slot or sidebar | When `docs/architecture/adr-*.md` count ≥ 5 (currently 5 ADRs already, threshold met) | ~1h |
  | 6 | **Dedicated sub-pages: Authentication, Concepts, Releases, Resources** (currently linked from Welcome card-grid to GitHub external) | When content for any one is ready (e.g., per-key rate-limit per ADR-0004 makes Auth page valuable) | ~1h per page |
  | 7 | **API Reference split into per-endpoint sub-pages** (`/api/jobs/`, `/api/generate/`, etc.) | When current single-page api.mdx exceeds ~500 LOC (currently ~200 LOC, threshold not met) | ~2h |
  | 8 | **i18n parity (pt-BR ↔ en)** — translate the 5 pages | When alpha BR adoption signals demand mirror Story 2.7's pt-BR-onboarding | ~4-6h |
  | 9 | **"Copy page" plugin** (e.g., `starlight-copy-page` or custom) | Quality-of-life polish, low signal value alone | ~30min |
  | 10 | **Versioned docs** (`/v0.4/api/`, `/v0.5/api/`) | First time a breaking SDK change makes "this version of the docs" relevant | ~2-3h setup + ongoing |
  | 11 | **Algolia DocSearch** (replace Pagefind) | Only if Pagefind perf or relevance becomes an issue at scale (>50 pages) | ~1-2h |

- **Suggested Owner:** `@dev` for impl + `@ux-design-expert` for design review on items 2, 3, 4
- **Estimated Effort (full bundle):** ~15-25h cumulative if all done in one push (unlikely — typically picked individually as triggers fire)
- **Tags:** docs, astro-starlight, web-docs, polish, v2, epic-2
- **Trigger:** Open. No blockers. Each item has its own trigger condition above; pull from this entry as needed.
- **Created:** 2026-04-30 by `@po` (Pax) at Story 2.9 close-out.

## Change Log

| Date | Author | Change |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2026-04-24 | @po (Pax) | Backlog file created. Registered TD-3.1.2 + TD-3.1.3 (both from Story 3.1 Round 2 deferrals). |
| 2026-04-24 | @po (Pax) | Added FU-4.2.1 (KV writes/day monitoring) + FU-4.3.1 (Workers Paid upgrade pre-flight) following user's gateway security + rate-limit ceiling question on Story 4.2. CF Workers Free hard-cap = 100K req/day + 1K KV writes/day; KV writes is the active constraint at ~500 calls/day combined ceiling. Recommended alpha policy: 300 calls/day combined for 3× headroom. |
| 2026-04-29 | @po (Pax) | Added ENH-2.9 (Refactor landing into Astro Starlight docs portal) following @ux-design-expert spec. Triggered by multi-image i2i merge (PR #15) needing docs update + user reference to RunPod docs portal pattern. Spec at `docs/design/landing-docs-portal-refactor.md`. |
| 2026-04-30 | @po (Pax) | **Closed ENH-2.9** — delivered via Story 2.9 (PR #19 main impl + PR #20 archive/tooling, both merged). QA gate PASS 96. Production live at `deploy-lp-one.vercel.app/` with new Astro Starlight docs portal. Effort actual ~14h (vs estimated ~9-12h, +2-5h drift driven by Codex sandbox blocker recovery + 2 QA rounds + 1 pre-cutover bug fix). **Added ENH-2.10** consolidating 11 V2 polish follow-ups (font bundling, light theme, IconLinkCard atom, custom 404, ADR index, dedicated sub-pages, API split, i18n, versioned docs, Algolia, "Copy page") with individual trigger conditions per item. |
